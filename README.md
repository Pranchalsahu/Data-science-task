# Data Science Task â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project demonstrates a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow using Python. The goal is to understand the structure and distribution of data using summary statistics and visualizations.

## Objective

To explore and visualize dataset features using Python libraries, identify patterns, correlations, and outliers for deeper understanding.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Activities

- Loaded and cleaned dataset for missing values and formatting
- Generated summary statistics and correlation matrix
- Created visualizations: bar plots, histograms, line charts, and heatmaps
- Analyzed relationships between numerical and categorical features

## Insights

- Highlighted variable distributions and skewness
- Found strong correlations
- Identified potential data quality issues and suggestions for feature engineering
